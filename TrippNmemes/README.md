How to use TrippNmemes meme generator
======
1. When you start up the application, you will see a tableView. If you go all the way to the bottom, you can see the tabs of a tabbar controller. You can select either a collectionView or a tableView.

3. You will get a blank screen with the text that reads "TOP" at the top and "BOTTOM" at the bottom.
